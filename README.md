## Setup

#todo

### Tools

Before starting development, make sure you have these tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - this is our JS runtime
- [Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) - this is our package manager
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) - helpful for testing API routes
- [MongoDB Community](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/) - necessary if you want to run database locally

### Environment

To define and manage environment variables, make sure to maintain `.env` files in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories. Ensure that `.env` is specified in your root `.gitignore` file to prevent pushing secrets. This should already be the case, but the secret scanner hook will check for this if something gets changed

Add the `.env.frontend` and `.env.backend` from the project google drive to their respective directories in your local branch. (not yet created)

### Backend

1. `cd backend`
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. If running the database locally, make sure to [start mongod](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/#start-mongod-processes)
4. `npm run start` to start the backend

If this works properly you should see a message in the terminal saying `> Listening on port 4000`

### Frontend

1. `cd frontend`
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
4. Server is started on port 3000. Follow this [url](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the development page.

## Linting

Run these commands in the `backend` or `frontend` directories for linting and formating. Be sure to run these commands before pushing to github.

- `npm run lint-fix` - fixes all auto-fixable lint errors and reformats code
- `npm run lint-check` - check all lint errors or code style issues without modifying any files
