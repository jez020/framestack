# CRED

A website revamp for Cred, an organization focused on providing help for post-incarcerated inviduals. This website aims to declutter the original website while adding modular features that allow the website to grow with the organization.

This website adds an admin portal to facilitate website integration into organization operations, including a custom form for clients to send their information.

## Setup

### Tools
Before starting development, make sure you have these tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - this is our JS runtime
- [Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) - this is our package manager
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) - helpful for testing API routes
- [MongoDB Community](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/) - necessary if you want to run database locally

### Environment
To define and manage environment variables, make sure to maintain `.env` files in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories. Ensure that `.env` is specified in your root `.gitignore` file to prevent pushing secrets. This should already be the case, but the secret scanner hook will check for this if something gets changed

Add the `.env.frontend` and `.env.backend` from the project google drive to their respective directories in your local branch. (not yet created)

### Backend

1. `cd backend`
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. If running the database locally, make sure to [start mongod](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/#start-mongod-processes)
4. `npm run start` to start the backend

If this works properly you should see a message in the terminal saying `> Listening on port 4000`

### Frontend

1. `cd frontend`
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
4. Server is started on port 3000. Follow this [url](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the development page.

## Linting
Run these commands in the `backend` or `frontend` directories for linting and formating. Be sure to run these commands before pushing to github.

- `npm run lint-fix` - fixes all auto-fixable lint errors and reformats code
- `npm run lint-check` - check all lint errors or code style issues without modifying any files
